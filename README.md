# insurance-charges-prediction
Introduction:

The goal of this project is to predict medical insurance charges using machine learning techniques. With the increasing cost of healthcare, the prediction of insurance charges can help individuals and insurance companies make informed decisions regarding healthcare expenses. In this report, I will outline the process we will follow to achieve our goal.

Project Goal:

My project aims to build a model that can predict the medical insurance charges for individuals based on their demographic and medical information. I will use machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and make predictions. My goal is to achieve high accuracy in our predictions and develop a model that can be used to assist insurance companies and individuals in making informed decisions about healthcare expenses.

Hypothesis:

My hypothesis is that I can develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict medical insurance charges for individuals based on their demographic and medical information. I believe that factors such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, and region will be strong predictors of medical insurance charges. By analyzing these factors and developing a model that incorporates them, I can achieve high accuracy in our predictions.
